## Visual Rhetoric In Ad Creative

Advertisements are not merely commercial messages but sophisticated visual compositions crafted to convey compelling narratives. They leverage various visual techniques including:

- Common-sense reasoning,
- Symbolism, and
- Recognition of non-photorealistic objects.

## Methodology

### Using CNNs

#### CNNs to Decode the Visual Rhetoric in an Ad Creative

For detailed insights, refer to our [notebook](ImageUnderstanding.ipynb) for CNN-based solution.

| Model Name | Train Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| ResNet152  | 79.28          | 79.96               |

### Using CLIP

#### Using ViT(Vision Transformers) based CLIP model

Explore our [CLIP Finetuning](Adv_CLIP/Adv_CLIP_Custom.ipynb) for detailed analysis.

| Model Name         | Train Accuracy | Validation Accuracy |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| CLIP(Original Weights) | --             | 90.2                |

 FPR(False Positive Rate) = 0.515
#### As you can see above even though the accuracy of CLIP is really high but also have high FPR, that's is because of CLIP being trained on very large general data.

### The FPR can be significatly reduced to ~(0.1 to 0.04) which can be achieved using full training of the model CLIP model and increasing the dataset size.
**Note:** CLIP can't be easily trained on small system and takes large time and compute

### Finetuned CLIP
| Model Name | Train Accuracy  | Validation Accuracy |
|----------|----------|----------|
| CLIP(Finetuned)   | 98   | 94.6   |


#### FPR(False Positive Rate) = 0.41

## Explaining Visual Features of Ad Creative

To provide a deeper understanding of ad creatives, we merge our CLIP model with a Language-Model using projection matrix. To do the same easily we can use LLaVA model which works the same way.
